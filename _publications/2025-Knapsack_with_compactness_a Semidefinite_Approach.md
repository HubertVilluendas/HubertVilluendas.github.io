excerpt: 'The min-knapsack problem with compactness constraints extends the classical knapsack problem, in the case of ordered items, by introducing a restriction ensuring that they cannot be too far apart. This problem has applications in statistics, particularly in the detection of change-points in time series. In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming approach for this problem, incorporating compactness in constraints or in objective. We study and compare the different relaxations, and argue that our method provides high-quality heuristics and tight bounds. In particular, the single hyperparameter of our penalized semidefinite models naturally balances the trade-off between compactness and accuracy of the computed solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate, on the hardest instances, the effectiveness and versatility of our approach compared to the existing mixed-integer programming formulation.'

The min-knapsack problem with compactness constraints extends the classical knapsack problem, in the case of ordered items, by introducing a restriction ensuring that they cannot be too far apart. This problem has applications in statistics, particularly in the detection of change-points in time series. In this paper, we propose a semidefinite programming approach for this problem, incorporating compactness in constraints or in objective. We study and compare the different relaxations, and argue that our method provides high-quality heuristics and tight bounds. In particular, the single hyperparameter of our penalized semidefinite models naturally balances the trade-off between compactness and accuracy of the computed solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate, on the hardest instances, the effectiveness and versatility of our approach compared to the existing mixed-integer programming formulation.
